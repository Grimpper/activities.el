** TODO An activity's last state might be saved at an undesirable moment

- State "TODO"       from              [2024-01-24 Wed 01:13]

For example, if I have an activity that has some Ement rooms displayed, and then ~ement-disconnect~, the room buffers are killed, leaving the windows displaying, e.g. the scratch buffer.  Then the activity is automatically saved, and when it's resumed, it shows the scratch buffer, requiring the user to manually reset the activity.
